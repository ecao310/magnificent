/**
 * Which chunk a bundled module belongs in.
 *
 * Left alone, this app builds as one ~565 kB file and every build closes with
 * Vite's "some chunks are larger than 500 kB" warning. Three quarters of that
 * file is recharts and the tree under it — the chart library, its redux store,
 * its d3 scales — and none of it is app code.
 *
 * The fix is not to defer it. The chart is the top of the main column and it
 * is the answer the page exists to give, so a dynamic `import()` would buy a
 * faster first paint of an empty box and pay for it with a render waterfall in
 * front of the one thing the reader came for — a chunk behind an `import()`
 * cannot be asked for until React has mounted the component that asks. What is
 * wrong with a single ~565 kB chunk is its granularity, not its size: every
 * deploy of this repo changes app code and nothing else, and undivided that
 * re-downloads recharts and React along with it.
 *
 * So: static chunks, layered app -> charts -> react, plus the 0.7 kB runtime
 * rolldown emits to link them. Vite writes a `modulepreload` for each into
 * index.html, so a first-time reader still fetches them in parallel off one
 * HTML parse and pays nothing for the split; a returning one fetches the
 * ~47 kB that changed and keeps the rest by content hash. Both vendor chunks
 * are under the 500 kB line, which is what retires the warning rather than
 * silencing it with `chunkSizeWarningLimit`.
 *
 * The rule reads "everything in node_modules that is not React is the chart
 * library" because recharts is the only other runtime dependency in
 * package.json. That is an invariant, not an observation, and `the build's
 * chunking` in src/guards/build.test.ts fails the moment a fourth dependency makes it
 * untrue — at which point this rule needs a name that is still honest.

/**
 * The rule above, in the shape rolldown wants: one group per chunk name, each
 * capturing the modules `chunkFor` sends to it.
 *
 * The obvious spelling is one group whose `name` is `chunkFor` itself —
 * rolldown accepts a name function and treats each string it returns as its
 * own group. Do not use it. Under that form rolldown emits a `react` chunk
 * holding only react-dom's 0.8 kB ESM wrapper and leaves react-dom itself in
 * `charts`, which is the exact split this rule exists to prevent and which no
 * assertion about `chunkFor` can see. One group per name, matched in order, is
 * the form that actually separates them: measured at 139.83 / 357.37 kB
 * against the name-function form's 0.80 / 496.78.
