   * seconds, and it throws rather than dropping the 101st. Writing on every
   * notch spent that budget inside one drag of the income slider, the throw
   * landed in an effect with no error boundary above it, and React unmounted
   * the document: the reader moved a slider and the page went black. So a
   * drag has to be one write, and a `replaceState` that fails has to stay
   * inside the page rather than take it down.
   *
   * Sixty notches is sixty synchronous re-renders of the whole page, chart
   * included, under jsdom: about 2s on a laptop and over 5s on a shared CI
   * runner, which is exactly vitest's default timeout. The timeout is the
