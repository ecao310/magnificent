 * Two columns, three measures, and one place they are written down.
 *
 * The shape this page had was a single 900px `#root`, and that one number was
 * doing two jobs at once: it was the reading measure *and* the whole width of
 * the page. So there was nowhere to put a configuration column, and every
 * input ended up stacked at the top of step 1 — which is why a reader looking
 * at step 3's chart could not see the benefit being priced under it.
 *
 * FI Calc's answer is two numbers instead of one: 44rem of reading column and
 * 18rem of configuration beside it. Both are now `:root` tokens and `#root`
 * is derived from them, so the page's width is a consequence of its columns
 * rather than a third number that has to be kept in step with them by hand.
 *
 * The first `it` is what keeps that true. It fails in the direction that
 * actually happens — not by someone rewriting the shell, but by a `900px`
 * typed into whichever rule is being edited, which from inside that rule
 * looks like nothing at all.
 *
 * The second is about the other thing this shape brought with it. Two columns
 * only work while there are two, and the configuration column pins: it sticks
 * to the top of the window while the reading column scrolls past it. The step
 * nav pinned to the head of that reading column until the nav came off the
 * page, which is why the count below is a floor rather than a pair. On a
 * phone there is one column and nothing may pin — a pinned configuration
 * panel there is the whole screen. So every `position: sticky` on this page
 * has to be taken back off in the collapse, and a new one that forgets to is
 * a bug nobody sees on the machine they wrote it on.
