/**
 * One return, priced three ways down the page: the curve it is standing on,
 * the figures at the point it stands, and the notes behind them. The rail
 * that describes the return stays beside all three.
 *
 * Two steps, in the order a reader builds them: the benefit they will
 * collect, and what the rest of their income does to it. Both price the same
 * return, so a figure set in step 1 is still set in step 2.
 *
 * The steps stay mounted and the window scrolls, where the tab strip this
 * replaced swapped one panel for another. Three reasons to scroll: a step you
 * have to click into existence reads as optional, and these are not; step 2
 * quotes figures the reader set in step 1, which only works if scrolling back
 * to them is possible; and printing or Ctrl-F now reaches everything rather
 * than the open panel. What it costs is length, which a step nav and a
 * next-step box used to pay for. Both came off with the four sections that
 * made the walk long enough to need them: two steps on one scroll are not a
 * flow a reader can be lost in, and a nav offering to carry them past one
 * heading is furniture charging rent.
 *
 * Six more sections have stood here. Four were tabs — Medicare, Strategies,
 * Over Time and State Taxes — and two were steps 3 and 4, Capital Gains
 * Stacking and Sizing the Conversion, which came off when this narrowed to the
 * torpedo alone. What they rendered went with them, and so has the arithmetic
 * underneath: the projection, sequencing, lump-sum, state-tax, gains-curve and
 * conversion-sizing modules are all out of the repo, and so is the 3.8% surtax
 * of IRC 1411, which outlived them by a pass as a term of a total that was
 * always zero. What is left in `lib/tax/` is what these two steps read.
 *
 * So the inputs are split across the steps that move them: filing status, age
 * and the benefit are step 1, and other ordinary income is step 2, being a
 * point on the axis its chart sweeps. Tax-exempt interest belongs to no axis
 * and sits in a collapsed block at the end of step 1, because it starts at $0
 * and at $0 leaves the chart identical.
 *
 * Nothing renders off a list of them any more. It carried a nav label, a
 * heading and a blurb per step until the nav and the next-step box went, and
 * the count a "Step 1 of 2" kicker numbered itself out of until the kickers
 * went too; the headings still shown are written where they are shown. What
 * is left is the one fact nothing else can supply — `StepId`, which the live
 * region is keyed to.
