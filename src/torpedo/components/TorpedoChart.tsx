/**
 * The dashed vertical marking the reader's own place on the chart.
 *
 * The slider underneath is a *position* on a curve that is already drawn, not
 * an input to it, and nothing on screen said so: an "Other Income" slider
 * sitting under a chart reads as the control that draws the curve. The line is
 * what says otherwise. It takes the colour of the slider that drives it —
 * amber — so the pairing is legible without reading a word, and a heavier dash
 * than the IRMAA cliffs it shares the chart with.
 *
 * It carries no label. It used to say "You are here" and then name both halves
 * of the axis figure in three stacked lines inside the plot, which is a strip
 * of curve about 250px wide spent on words that are said twice underneath
 * anyway: the caption under the axis names the benefit that does not move, the
 * slider beside it names the income that does, and the readout below says
 * which point on the curve this is and what it costs. The line only has to
 * point at it.
 *
 * A plain function, not a component: recharts identifies its children by
 * element type, and a wrapper component would render as an unknown child.

 * only where there is a pointer that can hover.
