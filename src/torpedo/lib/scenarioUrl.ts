/**
 * The return, written into the address bar and read back out of it.
 *
 * Every figure on the page is derived from six values, and until this file
 * existed all six lived only in React state: a refresh threw the return away
 * and there was nothing to send to a spouse or an advisor. Putting them in the query string
 * fixes both at once, because the address bar is already the share surface
 * every reader knows how to use. Every value it carries prices something: a
 * link is the return, and nothing that changes no figure belongs in it.
 *
 * Four decisions are worth writing down, since the encoding itself is
 * trivial and these are not.
 *
 * **The step is not in the link.** It is where the reader is looking, not what
 * the return holds, and the page already names places a better way: every
 * step is mounted and every section carries an `id`, so `#step-torpedo` is
 * a fragment the browser scrolls to on its own. The query string says what the
 * return *is*; the fragment says where on the page to stand. Putting the step
 * in the query string would also make the one control that changes nothing
 * about the return the one control that rewrites the address.
 *
 * **The year is not in the link either, and it used to be.** The page prices
 * `PAGE_TAX_YEAR` and offers no way to change it, so a year in the query
 * string would be a key that reads nothing — and a link that *looked* like it
 * carried a year while the page ignored it is worse than one that never
 * mentions it. Old links naming a year still open: `year=2025` is read past in
 * silence, with no note, because a reader arriving on one has nothing to be
 * told and no control to be pointed at. Every figure they see is a
 * `PAGE_TAX_YEAR` figure, which the page says in its own prose in a dozen
 * places.
 *
 * **Three more keys went the same way, and later.** `ltcg` sized the capital
 * gain inside the other income, `ceiling` picked the line a conversion was
 * sized against, and `qcd` set a charitable distribution against it; all three
 * steps came off the page as it narrowed to the torpedo, so all three keys now
 * name a control that is not there. `ltcg=20000` and `qcd=26750` are the
 * dangerous ones — both moved the curve — which is why they are read past
 * rather than honoured: a figure no reader can see, change or be told about is
 * worse than a figure the link never carried. Old links naming any of the
 * three open in silence, on the return the rest of their keys describe.
 *
 * **Writing is `replaceState`, never `pushState`.** A slider fires a change per
 * notch, so pushing would bury the back button under one entry per $500 of
 * income and make leaving the page a matter of holding it down. Replacing
 * keeps the address shareable and keeps Back meaning "the page I came from".
 *
 * **And not on every notch either.** Browsers rate-limit the history API, and
 * Safari throws rather than dropping the call that goes over — so writing
 * per notch put one ordinary drag past the limit and took the page down with
 * it. The address is written once the control has settled and once more on
 * arrival; `ADDRESS_SETTLE_MS` and `writeAddress` in
 * `hooks/useScenarioAddress.ts` are where that lives.
 *
 * Everything a link carries is clamped on the way in against the same bound
 * the page's own slider would have held it inside, and every clamp says what
 * it did — see `decodeScenario`. A link is the one input this app has that it
 * did not produce itself.
