          Many think of income tax rates as monotonically increasing, starting
          at 10% and climbing to 37%. However, because of how income tax works
          with Social Security, your marginal rate forms a
          torpedo shape, increasing and then decreasing. Use this tool to calculate
          your marginal tax rate based on your social security benefit.
