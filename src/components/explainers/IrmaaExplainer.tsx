        Above a MAGI threshold, Medicare adds an{' '}
        <strong>income-related monthly adjustment amount</strong> to the
        Part B and Part D premiums of everyone on the return who is
        enrolled. Unlike the torpedo, it is not a phase-in: one dollar over
        a threshold triggers the whole surcharge for twelve months. The
        chart above prices your own tier on hover, and{' '}
        <strong>Breakpoints</strong> in the corner of the plot draws the
        thresholds as red dashed lines. The
        first cliff this return
        can reach costs{' '}
        <strong>{formatCurrency(firstCliffStep)}</strong> a year
        {beneficiaries > 1 ? ' for the two of you' : ''} &mdash; on a single
        dollar of income.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines sit at less other income than their MAGI figures suggest,
        because the benefits the torpedo drags into AGI get there first
        {muniInterest > 0
          ? `, and because Medicare's MAGI is wider than the tax code's — the ${formatCurrency(muniInterest)} of tax-exempt interest set above is added straight back in, moving every line ${formatCurrency(muniInterest)} further left`
          : '. Medicare’s MAGI is also wider than the tax code’s: tax-exempt interest is added straight back in, so muni bonds move these lines as well as the torpedo'}
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The x-axis caveat.</strong> Medicare bills on a{' '}
        {IRMAA_LOOKBACK_YEARS}-year lag: the {year} premiums these lines are
        priced from are set by {irmaaMagiYear(year)} MAGI, so the {year}{' '}
        income on this chart is really setting the premium for{' '}
        {year + IRMAA_LOOKBACK_YEARS}, under a schedule CMS has not
        published yet. Treat the lines as where the cliffs would fall at{' '}
        {year} thresholds, not as a bill. The lag cuts both ways: a Roth
        conversion made now surfaces as a premium two years later, and a
        one-off spike &mdash; a home sale, an inherited IRA &mdash; keeps
        costing after the income is gone. Retiring or losing that income is
        a life-changing event you can appeal on Form SSA-44 rather than
        simply wait out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The surcharge never appears on a tax return, so nothing about the filing reveals that one
        dollar of income cost {formatCurrency(firstCliffStep)}.
